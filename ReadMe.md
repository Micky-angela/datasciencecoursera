This repository hosts the R code and files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

For the code to work smoothly, the script and features.txt should be put in the working directory. Test and train data should be placed in test and train directory separately.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
